Vehicle Inheritance Example
This project demonstrates the concept of Inheritance in Java by designing a base class Vehicle and extending it into two derived classes: Car and Bike. The example highlights how child classes inherit common attributes and methods from a parent class and add their specific behaviors.
📝 About the Project
The primary goal of this project is to showcase:

Inheritance: How child classes (Car and Bike) can inherit common properties and methods from a parent class (Vehicle).
Code Reusability: Shared attributes and methods are implemented once in the base class and reused across derived classes.
Polymorphism: Adding unique behaviors (applyBrakes for Car and kickStart for Bike) in child classes.

🌟 Features
Base class Vehicle with common attributes like:
brand
speed
Derived class Car with an additional method applyBrakes().
Derived class Bike with an additional method kickStart().
Demonstrates object creation for derived classes and usage of specific methods.
